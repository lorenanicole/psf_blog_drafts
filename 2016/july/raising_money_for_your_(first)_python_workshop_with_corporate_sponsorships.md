##Raising money for your (First) Python workshop with corporate sponsorships
####By Trey Hunner & Lorena Mesa

If you're planning to run a programming workshop, you'll probably need to raise money to cover the cost of food, venue, and decorations.  You can ask the PSF for a grant (and [you should](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/))!  But PSF grants aren't the only place to seek financial help for your workshop.  You should also consider identifying companies that will sponsor your event.

### Why would companies want to give you money?

~~*Myth: Companies aren't interested in your events.*~~ 

~~Take any group of coders and ask them how they found their job. You're more than likely to find that coders found their company because that company sponsored a workshops or a particular group or conference that interests them.~~

~~As a Python shop, then, it is in a company's interest to promote a Python events in their area! Companies receive quite a bit more than verbal recognition when they sponsor events they put themselves on the radar of passionate inquisitive coders, the type of folks they often want to hire!~~

Companies may be interested in sponsoring Python workshops for a number of reasons.  If a company is hiring new developers, they may hope to interest your volunteers and workshop attendees in working for their company or referring their friends to work for their company.  They may also want to raise awareness of their services to your workshop attendees.  Or they may simply be out to sponsor your event because it makes their employees feel good to assist constructive community-building efforts in their neighborhood.

Remember it is a **win-win relationship**. Companies receive several perks including marketing and recruitment traction.

### Who should you approach for funds first?

~~Obtaining corporate sponsorship isn't about convincing companies it is in their best interest to sponsor you: instead it's about finding the right companies to sponsor you.~~ (not sure what that statement means. A convincing pitch seems worthwhile.)

When targeting companies begin by **defining the audience of your event**: who is going to be participating?

By defining the audience for your event you can narrow the scope of companies you want to approach. Your audience makes your event unique and worth investing in!

For example PyLadies Chicago wanted to host a panel with women in data science and data engineering discussing how they entered the field and what they do. Our audience includes women software engineers who wish to learn about machine learning, big data, perhaps women interested in studying something like predictive analytics. 

From our audience we knew to look for companies that:

* Do lots of data processing or analytics
* Make intelligent (web) applications
* Are passionate about diversity 
* Offer training opportunities 

You cannot possibly approach every company there is, so make sure to **triage your potential sponsor list** based on the likelihood that a company will sponsor your event.

**Lastly it isn't about the volume of sponsors you have but the quality.**

**TODO**: How can we soften this language? I think it's really important not to dissuade but to manage expectations (prevent burn out and all :-) )... maybe we can instead angle this as a "seek out sponsors who want to be involved with your event and help you organize, plan on-site logistics, or be present during the day of your event".  It's good to have sponsors that feel they have some skin in the game.

It's more meaningful to have 2 good partners than to have 10 who don't care about your event. Likewise spamming companies for requests may make your future events be passed over. 

If you appeal to the companies that value your values in a way that speaks to their history of sponsorship you're bound to find many great partners. 


**TODO**: More info on how to refine the search for companies + link for more discussion?

### What should you promise companies in return for sponsorship?

Define some specific asks. Asking for a blanket sum of money could alienate companies.

You are the one driving the conversation and you are the one **setting expectations**.  As such you want to make sure that you clearly define what companies will receive in return for their sponsorship.

### How much money should we ask each company for?

**TODO**: make a prospectus with sponsorship tiers

### How many sponsorship tiers should we have?

If you've ever seen a sales page, you'll notice that many of them have three tiers.

You can think of three tier sponsorship plans like this:

1. Top tier: This one costs quite a bit but has big perks.  Most companies will not choose this one but it acts as a anchor to make other options seem even more affordable.
2. Middle tier: This is the plan that you expect most companies to go for.
3. Bottom tier: This is for companies that want to help out but are less concerned about paying to promote their brand.  Make sure not to set this too low.

### How much time should I spend on making a prospectus?

Making a good looking prospectus may seem like a waste of time, but keep in mind who will be looking at this document.  Your prospectus will likely be sent to someone you don't know: someone who has the authority to grant funds.  If you're asked to look over a sponsorship prospectus from someone you've never met before, would you rather see a plain text document that could have been put together in 5 minutes or a document that obviously had some thought and effort put into it?

### What should I include in my email asking for sponsorship?

Depending on the company you reach out to they may want more or less information. Some questions to ask yourself about how to frame your request:

* Does the company have a community outreach team?
* Has another organization worked with the company before?
* Does the company already participate in the Python community?

If a company has a community outreach team that means they're more experienced in working in the local tech scene but they may also receive lots of requests. Reach out to the team and ask them how they process requests. 

If you know another organizer that's worked with the company in question - great! Personal introductions establish a repoire and often helps you cut velvet rope. You also get first hand knowledge from the organizer how to chat with the company. 

If you don't have access to this information start simple by creating a budget and based on the big items such as food or swag you can offer sponsorship for those items or have generic sponsorship levels. Bigger events merit the latter approach whereas the former is more than sufficient for smaller events. 

Back to our PyLadies Chicago event we only needed a food and venue sponsor.

### When should you stop fundraising? How much funding is enough?

Again this depends on the scope of the event. Organizing a 2 hour panel with 50 attendees is significantly different than organizing a one day training workshop for 50 people. You'll want to plan to have a bigger cushion. 

**TODO**: Don't be too afraid of taking in too much money because you can use extra funding for future events. It's better to have too money leftover than to have your organizers lose money on a workshop.

**TODO**: Link to how to create a budget, perhaps more discussion?

For creating a detailed budget read this thing

Generally having extra isn't a terrible thing, depending on how you raise funds (receiving monies or having sponsor pay directly) you can have spare for another event. 

Be mindful of how much you ask for, you may want to work with the company again! 

And as always ask for recommendations!

There are several Python communities you can reach out to including:

* [PSF Community Listserv](mailto:PSF-community@python.org)
* [PyLadies Slack](slackin.pyladies.com/)
* [IRC Python channels](https://www.python.org/community/irc/)
* Twitter!

**TODO**: More and/or better resources?

### Do you need to tell potential sponsors about the other sponsors you'll have?

**TODO**

### A company committed but hasn't paid us yet. What should I do?

**TODO**
