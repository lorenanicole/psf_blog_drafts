##Raising money for your (First) Python workshop with corporate sponsorships
####By Trey Hunner & Lorena Mesa

If you're planning to run a programming workshop, you'll probably need to raise money to cover the cost of food, venue, and decorations.  You can ask the PSF for a grant (and [you should](https://www.python.org/psf/grants/))!  But PSF grants aren't the only place to seek financial help for your workshop.  You should also consider identifying companies that will sponsor your event.

### Why would companies want to give you money?

Companies may be interested in sponsoring Python workshops for a number of reasons.  If a company is hiring new developers, they may hope to interest your volunteers and workshop attendees in working for their company or referring their friends to work for their company.  They may also want to raise awareness of their services to your workshop attendees.  Or they may simply be out to sponsor your event because it makes their employees feel good to assist constructive community-building efforts in their neighborhood.

Remember it is a **win-win relationship**. Companies receive several perks including marketing and recruitment traction.

### Who should you approach for funds first?

When targeting companies begin by **defining the audience of your event**: who is going to be participating?

By defining the audience for your event you can narrow the scope of companies you want to approach. Your audience makes your event unique and worth investing in!

For example PyLadies Chicago wanted to host a panel with women in data science and data engineering discussing how they entered the field and what they do. Our audience includes women software engineers who wish to learn about machine learning, big data, perhaps women interested in studying something like predictive analytics. 

From our audience we knew to look for companies that:

* Do lots of data processing or analytics
* Make intelligent (web) applications
* Are passionate about diversity 
* Offer training opportunities 

You cannot possibly approach every company there is, so make sure to **triage your potential sponsor list** based on the likelihood that a company will sponsor your event.

**It isn't about the volume of sponsors you have but the quality.**

Sponsors that want to participate on the day of the event, those that are eager to talk to your community, these are good indicators of strong sponsors.

### What should you promise companies in return for sponsorship?

You are the one driving the conversation and you are the one **setting expectations**.  As such you want to make sure that you clearly define what companies will receive in return for their sponsorship.

*Ambiguous promise:* "We would like money for an event that will talk about Python in data science. We will talk about how you use data science too."

*Specific promise:* "We'd love for you to sponsor food for a Python data science panel. The panel will include women data scientists that will discuss how they started in data science and why Python is a great languge to learn for it. Since our community includes women looking to move into data science, we can highlight how data science is used at your company and current positions you have available!"


### How much money should we ask each company for?

**TODO**: make a prospectus with sponsorship tiers

### How many sponsorship tiers should we have?

If you've ever seen a sales page, you'll notice that many of them have three tiers.

You can think of three tier sponsorship plans like this:

1. Top tier: This one costs quite a bit but has big perks.  Most companies will not choose this one but it acts as a anchor to make other options seem even more affordable.
2. Middle tier: This is the plan that you expect most companies to go for.
3. Bottom tier: This is for companies that want to help out but are less concerned about paying to promote their brand.  Make sure not to set this too low.

### How much time should I spend on making a prospectus?

Making a good looking prospectus may seem like a waste of time, but keep in mind who will be looking at this document.  Your prospectus will likely be sent to someone you don't know: someone who has the authority to grant funds.  If you're asked to look over a sponsorship prospectus from someone you've never met before, would you rather see a plain text document that could have been put together in 5 minutes or a document that obviously had some thought and effort put into it?

### Who should I email in asking for a sponsorship?

Begin by answering the question "does the company already participate in the Python community"?

*If no:*

Tip 1: If you know another organizer that's worked with the company in question - great! Personal introductions establish a repoire and often helps you get past the velvet rope. You also get first hand knowledge from the organizer how to chat with the company. 

Tip 2: Does the company have an outreach team? Look for them on social media and ask them to chat.

*If yes:* Great, you know who to email!

### What should I include in my email asking for sponsorship?

If you don't have access to this information start simple by creating a budget based on the big items such as food or swag you can offer sponsorship for those items or have generic sponsorship levels. Bigger events merit the latter approach whereas the former is more than sufficient for smaller events. 

Back to our PyLadies Chicago event we only needed companies to sponsor food and space.

### When should you stop fundraising? How much funding is enough?

Again this depends on the scope of the event. Organizing a 2 hour panel with 50 attendees is significantly different than organizing a one day training workshop for 50 people. You'll want to plan to have a bigger cushion. 

**TODO**: Don't be too afraid of taking in too much money because you can use extra funding for future events. It's better to have too money leftover than to have your organizers lose money on a workshop.

**TODO**: Link to how to create a budget, perhaps more discussion?

Generally having extra isn't a terrible thing, depending on how you raise funds (receiving monies or having sponsor pay directly) you can have spare for another event. 

Be mindful of how much you ask for, you may want to work with the company again! 

And as always ask for recommendations!

There are several Python communities you can reach out to including:

* [PSF Community Listserv](mailto:PSF-community@python.org)
* [PyLadies Slack](slackin.pyladies.com/)
* [IRC Python channels](https://www.python.org/community/irc/)
* Twitter!

**TODO**: More and/or better resources?

### Do you need to tell potential sponsors about the other sponsors you'll have?

**TODO**

### A company committed but hasn't paid us yet. What should I do?

**TODO**
